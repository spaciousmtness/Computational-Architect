# Computational Sovereignty

A 47-day journey from non-technical to mastery over my personal computing environment.

## What This Is

Scripts and tools I'm building as I learn Python, terminal fluency, evaluation thinking, and AI agent coordination.

**Timeline:** January 13 - March 1, 2026

**Goal:** Build leverage through computational skills. Stop selling hours.

## Tools

- `daily_ritual.py` - Morning environment check
- `inbox_check.py` - Triage tool for processing queue
- `log_session.py` - Session logging and tracking
- `eval_response.py` - AI behavioral evaluation (sycophancy, refusal quality, bias)
- `assess_skill.py` - Mastery level assessment
- `capture.py` - PKM inbox capture

## Philosophy

*"I retain judgment and test; the system returns clarity."*

Building toward AI safety and prompt engineering work. Learning to coordinate human judgment with AI execution.

## Status

Day 7 of 47. Foundations phase.
